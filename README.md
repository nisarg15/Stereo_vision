## Requirements
       ***Important*****************************************************
       *Change the path for the input images for cv2.read*
       *Change the path for the output images for cv2.write*
       *Code takes time run like around 20 min*
       *****************************************************************
       
### To run this code, the following libraries are required
* OpenCV  
* NumPy


### Installation (For ubuntu 18.04) ###
* OpenCV
	````
	sudo apt install python3-opencv
	````
* NumPy
	````
	pip install numpy
	````
	
### Running code in ubuntu
After changing the path of the image source file and installing dependencies
Make sure that current working derectory is same as the directory of program
You can change the working derectory by using **cd** command
* Run the following command which will execute the code
````
Stereo Vision.py
````
* Select the data set by entering the digit using number pad
````

Enter the dataset you want to execute (enter 1, 2 or 3)):
````



### Troubleshooting ###
	Most of the cases the issue will be incorrect file path.
	Double check the path by opening the properies of the vdata set
	and copying path directly from there.

	For issues that you may encounter create an issue on GitHub.
